# Housing_Weather_Prediciton
Does nice weather influence people to sell and or buy houses? Something I always
wondered about the housing market was if weather had any relationship with the market,
specifically for Summer and Winter. Therefore, I decided to make this project based on this idea.
My hypothesis is that more houses are sold in the Summer compared to in the Winter, due to the
nice weather allowing for people to easily view homes. This was created for my python programming course(Project 1)
